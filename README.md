# Spring Boot Course Project

This project was created as part of a YouTube course to learn the fundamentals of Spring Boot.

After completing the course, the application was extended with additional improvements, documentation, and structural refinements. The codebase was then reviewed and validated using AI to ensure that the architecture and implementation follow modern best practices and are aligned with current Spring Boot standards.

## Purpose

This repository is intended purely for learning and experimentation. It demonstrates:

- Basic REST API development with Spring Boot
- Layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository)
- JPA with PostgreSQL
- Validation
- Basic testing setup
- Clean project structure
- Using Docker for creating a Postgresql Database

## Starting the App

To start the App follow these steps

1. Install Java JDK 25, Docker and IntelliJ
2. Clone Repo and open in IntelliJ
3. Execute "docker compose up -d" in the IntelliJ terminal
5. Run the app :)
